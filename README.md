This repository is for the project of the course Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera Platform

### How to run the script
It's easy to run the script.  
The file of the script is *run_analysis.R*, you just should do the command below:  
`source("run_analysis.R")`  
`run_analysis(file_path)`  
*file_path* is the only argument that should be given to the function and it is the file path of the fold *UCI HAR Dataset*. *file_path* is a string.  
If your *UCI HAR Dataset* fold's path is "~/Documents/course/getting-cleaning_data/projects/UCI HAR Dataset", just call:  
`source("run_analysis.R")`  
`run_analysis("~/Documents/course/getting-cleaning_data/projects/UCI HAR Dataset")`
